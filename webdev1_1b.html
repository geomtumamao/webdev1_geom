    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Half (1/2)</strong> cup soy sauce
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Half (1/2)</strong> cup white vinegar
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Four (4)</strong> to <strong>six (6)</strong> cloves garlic, minced
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One (1)</strong> teaspoon black peppercorns
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Two (2)</strong> to <strong>three (3)</strong> bay leaves
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Two (2)</strong> tablespoons cooking oil (vegetable or canola)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One (1)</strong> onion, chopped
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One (1)</strong> cup water
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One (1)</strong> to <strong>two (2)</strong> potatoes, peeled and sliced (optional)
    </li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <br />
  <br />
  <ol type="I">
    <li>
      In a large bowl or container, <u>combine</u> the chicken pieces, soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic,
      black peppercorns, and bay leaves.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Mix</u> everything well, ensuring the chicken is coated with the marinade.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Cover</u> and <u>refrigerate</u> for at least <strong>thirty (30)</strong> minutes to allow the flavors to 
      penetrate the chicken. For better results, <u>marinate</u> for a few hours or overnight.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Heat</u> the cooking oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Remove</u> the chicken pieces from the marinade, but <u>keep</u> the marinade for later use.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Sear</u> the chicken pieces in the hot oil until they turn golden brown on all sides. This step adds
      <small>flavor</small> and texture to the dish.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the chicken is browned, <u>add</u> the chopped onion and <u>saut√©</u> until it becomes translucent.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Pour</u> in the marinade (soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, peppercorns, and bay leaves) into the pan with
      the chicken and onions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Add</u> <strong>one (1)</strong> cup of water to the pan and bring everything to a boil.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Reduce</u> the heat to low, <u>cover</u> the pan, and let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or until the
      chicken becomes tender. If using potatoes, <u>add</u> them to the simmering mixture about halfway through
      the cooking time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Taste</u> the sauce and <u>adjust</u> the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. Keep in mind that the soy
      sauce is <small>salty</small>, so be cautious with the salt.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optional: If you want a variation called "Adobong Manok Sa Gata," you can <u>add</u> coconut milk (about 1 cup)
      during the last 10 minutes of simmering.
      This will give the dish a <small>creamy</small> and slightly <small>sweet</small> flavor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <u>Garnish</u> your Chicken Adobo with some chopped fresh cilantro, green onions, or fried garlic for extra flavor
      and presentation.
    </li>
